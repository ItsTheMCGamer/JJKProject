you are to read in their entirety, each individual files, making sure you understand them. Looking back at previous commits, identify the files that have not been modified. Once you have done this identify all the errors in each one and correct them. You cannot make changes to the unmodified files such as AbstractPacket.java. Then internally run the corrected code and once again check it. Repeat this until there are no more errors. Then check for any issues with the references or when these files are called elsewhere. Make sure you look at the etiquette used in this project. Only then, tell me what I need to do to fix this. Do not print out anything otherwise, just the final solution.

Fabulous! Now check the whole project in its entirety and tell me if there are any issues.
